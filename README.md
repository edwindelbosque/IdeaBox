# IdeaBox
## Created by Jeannie Evans, Edwin Del Bosque & Elyse Myers
### Summary
This is the third project of Module 1 at the Turing School of Software & Design. IdeaBox is a project that focuses on continuing to develop the skills of writing semantic HTML, clean & organized CSS and DRY JavaScript. It also introduces the concepts of DOM manipulation, as well as client-side data persistence using localStorage.

IdeaBox is an idea reminder application that is a great place to store your latest and greatest (or not) ideas!! IdeaBox allows you to create ideas with the ability to create a unique title and content for each card. Additionally, you can star ideas to mark them as important and also select a quality score for each - choose from swill, plausible or genius. Once you have added all of your ideas, filter and sort them by quality or importance. The search bar will also allow you search the text of your cards to find exactly what you're looking for.
